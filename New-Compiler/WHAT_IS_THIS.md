This directory you are in, is a rewrite of the DawnLang compiler using the DawnLang language. The goal for this compiler is to be FULLY introduced by DawnLang 1.5.0 or earlier, however it will be introduced in sectional parts. For example, in the 1.1.0 release of DawnLang, the parser might be written in DawnLang while the rest is still written in C#, and then the 1.2.0 update might have the debugger written in DawnLang etc.
